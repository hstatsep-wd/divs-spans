# DIVs and SPANs
---
_The purpose of this project is to help you practice using_ `<div>` _and_ `<span>` _elements in their proper syntax._

## Before you begin
Observe the files in this project:  

* `README.md` is the file you're reading.
* `index.html` is where you will be doing your coding.
* `result.png` is the result you should be aiming for with `index.html`.
* `style.css` is the styling that will make `index.html` look pretty. You're welcome. (you do not need to edit this file)

## Directions
* Fork this project.
* Wrap all content inside `body` in one `div` with the attribute `class="wrapper"`.  
  * Don't forget to add a `</div>` at the end (right before `</body>`).
* Wrap all similarities in one `div` with the attribute `class="similarities"`.  
* Wrap all differences in one `div` with the attribute `class="differences"`.  
* Wrap the words **containers**, **block**, and **inline** in _their own_ `span` elements with attribute `class="blue"`.
* When you are finished, the preview should look like `result.png`.
* Make sure your identations are correct so that you can easily see which elements are _inside_ of others (very helpful for debugging `div`s).  
* If you finish early, add a section to the bottom with links to helpful resources for learning more about `<div>`s and `<span>`s.

Happy coding!
